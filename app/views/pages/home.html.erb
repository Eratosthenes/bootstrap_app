      Traditionally, there have been three ways to learn how to correctly identify plants
      in the wild, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

          Having an expert guide or naturalist available to identify plants is probably the
          easiest way; but today it can be difficult to find such a leader who is available
          both where and when you want one. Experts frequently tend to use the more confusing
          technical words which can be hard to follow.

        Formal classroom instructions is another way to learn how to correctly identify
        plants. But classes in local flora (how to identify plants found in the wild locally)
        are hard to find, infrequently scheduled and often expensive. They can involve months
        of classroom work and many field trips. This type of instruction also typically
        requires learning a large number of technical terms many of which are not easily
        remember unless they are used frequently.

        Printed field guides from reputable sources such as The Audubon Society, National
        Geographic, The National Wildlife Federation and Peterson have provided a good solution
        to the problems with expert guides and classroom instruction.  These are affordable
        and easier to use than the plant manuals used by professional botanists; but they
        have their problems too.  While they are relatively light weight they are bulky and
        do not readily fit into normal sized pockets.  In addition, you usually need three
        or more guides if you want to identify Wildflowers, ferns and trees which adds to
        the bulk and weight you need to carry. Their biggest drawback is that they are not
        comprehensive.  In their effort to help identify the greatest number of "common"
        plants in too broad an area such as "Eastern North America" they have had to exclude
        a large number of plants that are "less than common" even though those "less than
        common" plants may be common where you are.

      At Wild Plant ID we are working to develop an app for smartphones which we believe
      will overcome these difficulties in identifying wild plants.  We hope you will explore
      the rest of our website to see how we plan to accomplish this goal.
