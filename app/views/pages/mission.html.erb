          The mission of the Wild Plant ID is to design, build, deploy, and maintain a
          software application template which enables amateurs to accurately identify wild
          plants in individual ecologically defined areas using pocketable computing devices.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are three objectives which make this app unique among both printed and digital
          field guides. In these three critical objectives the application is to be:

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-2">
          <div id="green_leaf_div"><%= image_tag 'green_leaf.gif', :id => 'green_leaf' %></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p >
      1. <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Customizeable</strong> - The application will be adaptable so that any interested individual
      or group would be able to create a Wild Plant ID application of their own, ecologically defined area.
      </p>

      <p >
      2. <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Comprehensive</strong> - Including all native and naturalized, field-identifiable plants
      including wildflowers, ferns, and trees any place in the watershed. Only plants too
      small for field identification will not be included.
      </p>

      <p >
      3. <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Exclusive</strong> - Including only plants found in a limited, specific watershed. You
      won't have to wade through identifying plants not found in your watershed.
